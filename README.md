# Source Maps

This module is a very early work in progress, which has as end goal to allow lightning fast parsing, compiling and manipulation of sourcemaps, while being able to stringify and parse to a minimal footprint.

Mozilla's SourceMap module already handles most of this and this module is heavily based and inspired by the sourcemaps module, but is a complete rewrite in cpp to hopefully allow lightning fast manipulations.
